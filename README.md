# dotfiles
Required packages: git, vim, zsh, man, openssh and a powerline font.

This repo should be cloned after oh-my-zsh and zsh-syntax-highlighting have been installed.

After installation, PlugInstall should be run:

```zsh
vim +PlugInstall +qall
```

This does not set up ssh keys, but does setup some ssh configuration.
